# ## Children's Oncology Group (COG) - Cell Line Selection Prioritization
# 
# We are ordering many COG cell lines to include in the Pediatric Cancer Cell Morphology Atlas (PCCMA).
# We are ordering these in tranches.
# 
# We will periodically update the `pccma_cog_prioritization_list.csv`, as we receive and onboard the cell lines of each tranche.
# This google sheet is named `PCCMA COG cell lines` internally.
# 
# ### Initial prioritization
# 
# 1. Aggressive non-NBL cell lines
# 2. Highly aggressive NBL cell lines (PD+)
# 3. non-NBL cell lines at diagnosis
# 4. NBL cell lines at diagnosis or single progression (PD-)
# 
# #### We further broke down these prioritizations into letter groups
# 
# - 1a/b: If group 1 grows in (a) 20%O2 or (b) less than 20%O2
# - 2a/b/c: If group 2 grows in (a) 20%O2 or (b) less than 20%O2, or, (c) if a PD- cell line is matched with PD+
# - 3a/b: If group 3 grows in (a) 20%O2 or (b) less than 20%O2
# - 4a/b/c/d/e: If group 4 grows in (a) 20%O2 with known telomere maintenance or (b) with unknown telomere maintenance or (c) grows in less than 20% O2 with matches to other cell lines or (d) with known telomere maintenance without matches or (e) unknown telomere maintenance without matches
# 
# #### We included a few other criteria, which influenced priorization accordingly
# 
# - longdoubling: If the cell line has a doubling time >80 hours (we included these sparingly)
# - PDmatch: If cell lines have matches for progressive disease (we increased these in priority)
# - DXmatch: If cell lines have matches for both diagnosis and progressive disease (we increased these in priority)
# 
# ### Updated prioritization
# 
# Because not all cell lines pass Cell Painting onboarding, we need to recalibrate at each tranche.
# We will use this notebook for recalibration.
